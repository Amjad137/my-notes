### ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified Student Progress Score (SPS) Formula**

### Suggested Equation:

$$
\text{SPS} = (A \times w_1) + (AT \times w_2) + (EC \times w_3)
$$

### Where:
- **`A`** = Academic Score (e.g., average of tests and assignments)
- **`AT`** = Attendance (percentage of school attendance)
- **`EC`** = Extra/Co-Curricular Activities (e.g., participation in events, sports, clubs)

### Suggested Weights:
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Academic (A) | 50% or `0.50` |
| Attendance (AT) | 30% or `0.30` |
| Extra/Co-Curricular (EC) | 20% or `0.20` |

### ðŸ“˜ **Example Calculation:**

Letâ€™s say for a student:

- **Academic Score**: 85/100  
- **Attendance**: 95%  
- **Extra-Curricular**: 8/10 (Converted to 80%)

Now, plug these values into the formula:

$$
\text{SPS} = (85 \times 0.50) + (95 \times 0.30) + (80 \times 0.20) = 42.5 + 28.5 + 16 = 87
$$

So, the **Student Progress Score (SPS) = 87/100**

### ðŸ“Š **Simplified Tracking in EASNA**:

- **Academic Score (A)**: Automatically pulled from tests, assignments, or gradebooks.
- **Attendance (AT)**: Automatically tracked based on system records.
- **Extra/Co-Curricular (EC)**: Teachers/admins can input participation scores or points based on student involvement in events.
