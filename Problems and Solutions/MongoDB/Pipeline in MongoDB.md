## **Deep Dive into MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline and `$sum: 1`**

### **1️⃣ What is a Pipeline in MongoDB?**

A **pipeline** in MongoDB refers to a sequence of **data processing stages** applied to documents in a collection. These stages are processed in order, and the **output of one stage becomes the input of the next stage**, similar to a conveyor belt in a factory.

It is primarily used in **MongoDB Aggregation Framework**, which allows you to **transform and analyze data** efficiently.

### **Example of a Pipeline in Real Life**

Imagine a **coffee shop** where you order a coffee:

1. **Step 1 - Order Received** → The cashier takes your order.
2. **Step 2 - Prepare Coffee** → The barista makes the coffee.
3. **Step 3 - Serve Coffee** → The coffee is handed to you.

Each step depends on the **previous step**. Similarly, in MongoDB, **each pipeline stage modifies the data and passes it to the next stage**.

### **Pipeline Structure in MongoDB**

A pipeline is an **array of stages**, where **each stage begins with a `$` operator**.

#### **Basic Structure:**

```json
[
  { "$match": { "status": "active" } },  
  { "$group": { "_id": "$category", "count": { "$sum": 1 } } },
  { "$sort": { "count": -1 } }
]
```

Each stage processes documents in the collection:

4. **`$match`** → Filters documents (like SQL `WHERE`).
5. **`$group`** → Groups documents and applies aggregations (like SQL `GROUP BY`).
6. **`$sort`** → Sorts results (like SQL `ORDER BY`).

## ** Summary**

### ✅ **MongoDB Pipeline:**

- A **series of stages** that **process documents sequentially**.
- Each **stage’s output** feeds into the **next stage**.
