install globally
npm install -g run-rs

Sometimes issue may arise:
### ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s happening?

Youâ€™re installing `run-rs`, which depends on `kerberos`, which uses native code â€” and that **requires C++ build tools** on Windows.

Right now, itâ€™s failing because:

- You **donâ€™t have Visual Studio build tools installed**, specifically the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
    
- Node-gyp canâ€™t compile native modules like `kerberos` without them

### âœ… How to fix this (only needs to be done once)

#### ðŸ”§ Step 1: Install **Visual Studio Build Tools**

Download from here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

During install, **check this workload**:

âœ… **"Desktop development with C++"**

That includes all the compilers and SDKs needed for Node.js native modules.
