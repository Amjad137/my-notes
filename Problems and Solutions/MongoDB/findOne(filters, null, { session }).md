Ah, good eye! Let’s break down this line:

```js
return this.model.findOne(filters, null, { session });
```

This is a Mongoose `findOne()` query. Its syntax is:

```js
Model.findOne(filter, [projection], [options], [callback])
```

So in your case:

- `filters` → the query filter (`{ name: 'Alice' }`, etc.)
- `null` → the **projection** (i.e., which fields to return)
- `{ session }` → the **options**, like using a transaction session

---

### 🤔 So Why `null`?

The `null` means:  
> “Don’t apply any field projection — return **all fields**.”

It's just being **explicit**.

You could also leave it out entirely:

```js
this.model.findOne(filters, { session });
```

That works the same — because if you skip the second argument, Mongoose assumes you want all fields.

---

### TL;DR:

✅ `null` = no projection  
✅ It's optional — just being explicit  
✅ Could be replaced with actual projections like `{ name: 1, email: 1 }`

Let me know if you're working with sessions or projections — I can give examples tailored to that!
