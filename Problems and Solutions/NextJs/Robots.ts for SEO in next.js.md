In a **Next.js App Router** project,

```
apps/web/app/robots.ts
```

is a **special file** used to generate your siteâ€™s **robots.txt**.

---

## ðŸ¤– What is robots.txt?

* Itâ€™s a file at the root of your domain (`/robots.txt`).
* Tells **search engine crawlers** (Google, Bing, etc.) which pages they can or cannot index.
* Example:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ How Next.js handles `robots.ts`

* Instead of writing a static `robots.txt`, you can create a **dynamic one** in your Next.js app.
* Next.js will **auto-serve it at `/robots.txt`**.

Example:

```ts
// apps/web/app/robots.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [
      {
        userAgent: "*",
        allow: "/",
        disallow: ["/admin", "/dashboard"],
      },
    ],
    sitemap: "https://example.com/sitemap.xml",
  };
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits

* **Dynamic**: You can change rules based on environment (e.g., block indexing in dev/staging).
* **Integrated**: Works with Next.js `app` directory.
* **SEO-friendly**: Automatically served at `/robots.txt`.

---

âœ… **Summary:**
`app/robots.ts` in Next.js is a **special file for generating robots.txt dynamically**.
It helps control how search engines crawl your site.

ðŸ‘‰ Want me to also show you how the sibling `sitemap.ts` works in the same way?

# What's userAgent here?

Great follow-up ðŸ‘Œ

In **robots.txt** (and in your `robots.ts` inside Next.js), the `userAgent` property specifies **which web crawlers (bots)** the rules apply to.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a user-agent?

* A **user-agent** is basically the **name of a crawler/bot**.
* Examples:

  * `Googlebot` â†’ Googleâ€™s search engine crawler
  * `Bingbot` â†’ Microsoft Bingâ€™s crawler
  * `DuckDuckBot` â†’ DuckDuckGoâ€™s crawler
  * `*` â†’ Wildcard, means **all crawlers**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example in Next.js (`robots.ts`)

```ts
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [
      {
        userAgent: "*", // applies to ALL bots
        allow: "/",      // allow everything
        disallow: ["/admin", "/dashboard"], // block these paths
      },
      {
        userAgent: "Googlebot", // applies ONLY to Googlebot
        allow: ["/", "/blog"],  // allow root & blog
        disallow: ["/private"], // block private
      },
    ],
    sitemap: "https://example.com/sitemap.xml",
  };
}
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ How it works

* Crawlers check your `/robots.txt` before crawling your site.
* If the `userAgent` matches their bot name, they follow those rules.
* If no rule matches, they assume **allowed by default**.
* `*` works as a fallback for all bots.

---

âœ… **Summary:**
`userAgent` in `robots.ts` = identifies **which crawler the rule applies to**.

* `"*"` â†’ all crawlers
* `"Googlebot"` â†’ only Googleâ€™s bot
* You can create different rules per bot if needed.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also give you a **list of the most common crawler user-agent names** (Google, Bing, etc.) that developers usually include?
