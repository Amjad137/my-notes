refer what's style tag: [[style tag in Reactjs]]

Great follow-up â€” since you've changed from:

```tsx
<style jsx global>
```

to:

```tsx
<style>
```

â€¦let's break down the implications of both **so you can decide whatâ€™s best long-term**.

---

## âœ… What's the Difference?

### ðŸ§± 1. `<style jsx global>`

- This is **Next.js-specific** (comes from `styled-jsx`, which Next.js supports out of the box).
- It applies styles **globally** â€” just like regular CSS â€” but scoping is managed better.
- It helps avoid **duplication** and **unintended collisions** compared to plain `<style>`.

```tsx
<style jsx global>{`
  .ProseMirror {
    min-height: 150px;
  }
`}</style>
```

**Pros:**
- You can write normal CSS.
- Still scoped to the file in a controlled way.
- Works well with server-side rendering.

**Cons:**
- Still global â€” so naming conflicts are possible.
- Tailwind can't optimize these styles.
- Not reusable between components.

### ðŸ§± 2. `<style>` (Plain React)

This is what you're using now:

```tsx
<style>
  {`
    .ProseMirror {
      ...
    }
  `}
</style>
```

This works in plain React, not just Next.js.

**But itâ€™s more dangerous**:
- It's truly **global** â€” if multiple components inject the same class, there can be conflicts or overrides.
- React doesn't deduplicate â€” you'll get multiple identical style tags in the DOM if you mount the component multiple times.
- Not optimized, not scoped, no cleanup.

---

## ðŸ§­ Soâ€¦ Should You Keep It?

**You should only keep the plain `<style>` tag if:**
- Youâ€™re just quickly prototyping or working in a small app
- You know the component is mounted only once
- You're not planning to reuse this component elsewhere

**Otherwise**, the better long-term approaches are:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| âœ… `style jsx global` | You're in a Next.js project and want one-off global styles with a bit more safety. |
| âœ… CSS Modules | You want **scoped, maintainable** styles per component (recommended for reusable components). |
| âœ… Tailwind classes | You want to keep styles inside JSX using utility-first, JIT-optimized classes. |

---

### ðŸ”§ Suggested Next Steps

If you want the best of all worlds (scoped, safe, maintainable):

1. Move styles like `.ProseMirror`, `.parent-code-mention` to a `ParentCodeTextArea.module.css` file.
2. Import and apply them like this:

```tsx
import styles from './ParentCodeTextArea.module.css';

...

HTMLAttributes: {
  class: styles.parentCodeMention
}

...

<div className={styles.editorWrapper}>
  <EditorContent ... />
</div>
```

Would you like help creating that CSS module and refactoring the component accordingly?
