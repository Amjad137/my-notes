```typescript
<Image
                src={url}
                alt={`Preview image ${i + 1}`}
                layout='fill'
                className='object-cover'
                priority={i === 0}
              />
```

The `priority` prop in Next.js Image component is used to tell Next.js to prioritize loading that specific image. When set to `true`:

            1. The image will be preloaded automatically
            2. It will load with higher priority than other images
            3. It's especially useful for images that are "above the fold" 
               (visible when the page first loads)

In your code, `priority={i === 0}` means the first image in the carousel (i === 0) will be prioritized for loading. This is good practice since users will see this image first.

            You should use `priority` for:
            - Hero images
            - Large banner images
            - Above-the-fold content images
            - The first image in a carousel/slider

            But don't overuse it - only mark truly important images as priority, as marking too many can negatively impact performance.
