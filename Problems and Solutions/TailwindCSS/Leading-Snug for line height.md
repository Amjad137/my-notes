In **Tailwind CSS**, `leading-snug` is a **utility class** that controls the **line-height** (spacing between lines of text).  

### **`leading-snug` in Detail**
- It sets `line-height` to **1.375** times the font size.
- It makes text slightly tighter than the default spacing.

### **Example Usage**
```html
<p class="text-lg leading-snug">
  This is an example of text with a snug line height.
</p>
```

### **Comparison with Other Line-Height Utilities**
| Class         | Line-Height |
|--------------|------------|
| `leading-none`  | `1` (very tight) |
| `leading-tight` | `1.25` (tight) |
| `leading-snug`  | `1.375` (moderately tight) |
| `leading-normal` | `1.5` (default) |
| `leading-relaxed` | `1.625` (a bit loose) |
| `leading-loose` | `2` (very loose) |

### **When to Use `leading-snug`**
- When you want **slightly tighter** text spacing without making it too cramped.
- Useful for **headings, subtitles, or UI elements** where tighter spacing looks better.
