# Endpoint Order Analysis: Route Conflicts

## Yes, There's a Potential Conflict

Your endpoint structure has a subtle but important issue with route pattern matching. The order of routes matters in most web frameworks, including Hono.

## Current Order (Potentially Problematic)

```
1. POST /               - Create user
2. GET /                - Get all users
3. GET /:id             - Get user by ID (matches ANY string)
4. PATCH /verify        - Verify users
5. PATCH /:id           - Update user
6. DELETE /:id          - Delete user
7. PATCH /status        - Update status
```

## The Issue

When you define `GET /:id` before specific routes like `/verify` or `/status`, the pattern matcher might interpret those specific paths as IDs:

- `GET /verify` → Matches as `GET /:id` where `id = "verify"`
- `GET /status` → Matches as `GET /:id` where `id = "status"`

While your current routes don't conflict because they use different HTTP methods (GET vs PATCH), this is still a potential issue for future development.

## Recommended Route Order

```typescript
// Fixed paths first
userHandler.post('/', ...);
userHandler.get('/', ...);
userHandler.patch('/verify', ...);
userHandler.patch('/status', ...);

// Pattern routes last
userHandler.get('/:id', ...);
userHandler.patch('/:id', ...);
userHandler.delete('/:id', ...);
```

This ordering ensures specific routes always take precedence over pattern routes, avoiding conflicts even if you add more HTTP methods in the future.
