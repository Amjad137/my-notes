In Next.js or any React-based web application, you have several options for displaying text on the UI. You can use standard HTML tags like `<p>`, `<span>`, `<div>`, or even specialized components if you're using a UI library like Material-UI or Ant Design.

Considering that you want to control the text size using Tailwind CSS classes, you might typically use a `<span>` or `<div>` element along with Tailwind CSS classes to style the text. For example:

```jsx
// Using a div element
<div className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">Hello, World!</div>

// Using a span element
<span className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">Hello, World!</span>
```

Both `<div>` and `<span>` can be styled using Tailwind CSS classes effectively. The choice between them typically depends on your layout structure. `<div>` is a block-level element, while `<span>` is an inline element. If you want the text to be part of a block-level structure, use `<div>`. If you want the text to be inline within another element, use `<span>`.

For example, if you want the text to be part of a paragraph, you would use `<span>`:

```jsx
<p>
  This is a paragraph with <span className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500">styled text</span>.
</p>
```

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific use case and the surrounding structure of your UI.
