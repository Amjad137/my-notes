Great question ðŸ‘Œ â€” youâ€™re bumping into how **Prisma ORM** (and many ORMs in general) represent **relations**.

---

### 1. **Database vs. Prisma Model**

* In the **database**, only the `Visit` table will actually store a `patientId` column (foreign key).
* In **Prisma**, you can model the reverse side of the relationship (`visits: Visit[]`) **without a `visitIds` column** in `Patient`.

So:

* `Patient` table â†’ no `visitIds` column.
* `Visit` table â†’ has `patientId` (FK).
* `visits: Visit[]` in Prisma is just a **virtual relation field** that tells Prisma:

  > "When I query a Patient, I can also fetch all related Visit records."

---

### 2. **Why no `visitIds` array?**

Databases donâ€™t normally store an array of foreign keys in a single column. Instead, the relationship is managed in the **child table**:

* **One-to-Many** (Patient â†’ Visits):

  * One `Patient` has many `Visit`s.
  * Each `Visit` row stores the `patientId`.

If you stored `visitIds` inside Patient, youâ€™d need to manage an **array of foreign keys** (harder to maintain, violates normalization).

---

### 3. **What `visits: Visit[]` Does in Prisma**

It enables you to write queries like:

```ts
// Get patient with all visits
const patient = await prisma.patient.findUnique({
  where: { id: "p123" },
  include: { visits: true },
});
```

And Prisma will automatically:

* Look in the `Visit` table,
* Find all rows with `patientId = p123`,
* Return them under `visits`.

But again, **no `visitIds` column exists in the DB** â€” Prisma resolves it using the FK in `Visit`.

---

### 4. **Analogy**

Think of `visits: Visit[]` as a **shortcut** Prisma gives you:

* In raw SQL, youâ€™d need a `JOIN` between `Patient` and `Visit`.
* In Prisma, the relation field gives you that JOIN automatically.

---

âœ… **Answer in one line:**
`visits: Visit[]` doesnâ€™t mean `visitIds` column exists; itâ€™s a **virtual relation field** Prisma generates so you can navigate the one-to-many relation in code, while the actual FK (`patientId`) lives in the `Visit` table.

---

Do you want me to show you the **underlying SQL schema** that Prisma will generate from this model? That way youâ€™ll see how `visits[]` translates under the hood.
