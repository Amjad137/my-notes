Good eye ðŸ‘€ â€” this is where **Prisma relation naming** comes into play.
Letâ€™s break it down with your `Visit` â†” `Member` setup.

---

## 1. **The Scenario**

You have two different relationships between `Visit` and `Member`:

* `assignedDoctor` â†’ the doctor responsible for the visit.
* `createdBy` â†’ the staff member who created the visit record.

Both point to the same model (`Member`), but they serve **different roles**.

---

## 2. **The Problem Without Naming**

If you just wrote:

```prisma
model Visit {
  assignedDoctor Member @relation(fields: [assignedDoctorId], references: [id])
  createdBy      Member @relation(fields: [createdById], references: [id])
}
```

Prisma would get **confused** because:

* Both relations are between `Visit` and `Member`.
* Prisma needs a way to tell them apart on the `Member` side.

Otherwise, how would it know which `Visit[]` list belongs to which relation?

---

## 3. **The Solution â†’ Named Relations**

Thatâ€™s why you add a **string name** inside `@relation("...")`.
Itâ€™s just a **label** for Prisma to match the two sides of a relation.

### Example:

```prisma
model Visit {
  assignedDoctorId String
  assignedDoctor   Member @relation("AssignedDoctor", fields: [assignedDoctorId], references: [id])

  createdById      String
  createdBy        Member @relation("CreatedVisits", fields: [createdById], references: [id])
}
```

```prisma
model Member {
  assignedVisits Visit[] @relation("AssignedDoctor") // visits where this member is doctor
  createdVisits  Visit[] @relation("CreatedVisits")  // visits created by this member
}
```

---

## 4. **What This Means**

* `@relation("AssignedDoctor")` links:

  * `Visit.assignedDoctor`
  * `Member.assignedVisits`

* `@relation("CreatedVisits")` links:

  * `Visit.createdBy`
  * `Member.createdVisits`

So Prisma can correctly generate navigation fields in both directions.

---

## 5. **Analogy**

Think of it like labeling two different friendships:

* Alice is Bobâ€™s **best friend**.
* Alice is Bobâ€™s **gym buddy**.

If you donâ€™t give names, the system canâ€™t tell which is which.
`@relation("AssignedDoctor")` = "best friend"
`@relation("CreatedVisits")` = "gym buddy"

---

âœ… **Answer in one line:**
Those `createdVisits` and `assignedVisits` fields are the **reverse relation fields** in `Member`, and the string inside `@relation("...")` is a **name to disambiguate multiple relations** between the same two models.

---

Would you like me to also show you **the SQL schema that Prisma will generate for these two relations** so you see how the `@relation("...")` string doesnâ€™t create extra columns, only helps Prisma map them?
