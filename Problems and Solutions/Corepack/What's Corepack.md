**Corepack** is a package manager shim that comes bundled with Node.js (starting from version 16.9.0 and 14.19.0). Its primary role is to act as an interface for managing package managers like Yarn and pnpm.

Corepack ensures that the exact package manager version specified in a project's `package.json` is used. This makes it easier to maintain consistency across development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and production.

### Why Do We Need Corepack?

1. **Version Consistency**:  
    Corepack ensures that every developer or CI/CD pipeline uses the same version of the package manager specified in the project. This eliminates discrepancies caused by different versions of tools.
    
2. **Ease of Use**:  
    Developers don't have to manually install or manage specific versions of package managers like Yarn or pnpm. Corepack handles downloading and activating the required version.
    
3. **Built-In Support**:  
    Since Corepack is included with Node.js, you don’t need an additional installation step for your package manager. It streamlines the setup process for projects.
    
4. **Legacy Support**:  
    Projects that depend on older package manager versions can still function without needing to upgrade to the latest versions.
    
5. **Security**:  
    Corepack ensures that only the specified version is used, avoiding unexpected behavior caused by different or outdated versions of package managers.

### How Does Corepack Work?

1. **`packageManager` Field in `package.json`**:  
    When the `packageManager` field is present in `package.json`, Corepack ensures the specified version is used.
    
    ```json
    {
      "packageManager": "yarn@4.3.0"
    }
    ```
    
2. **Automatic Installation**:  
    Corepack downloads and activates the exact version of the package manager specified.
    
3. **Command Replacement**:  
    Corepack replaces commands like `yarn` or `pnpm` with the appropriate version of the tool, as defined in the project configuration.

### Why Use Corepack for Your Project?

If you’re collaborating on a team or setting up CI/CD workflows, you’ll want consistent behavior regardless of where the code runs. Corepack simplifies this by ensuring:

- Everyone uses the same package manager version.
- Development environments and production setups match perfectly.
- You avoid version-related issues when upgrading tools.

In your case, Corepack is critical because your project explicitly specifies Yarn 4.3.0, while your system has Yarn 1.x globally installed. Without Corepack, you'd have to manually install and manage Yarn versions, which can be tedious and error-prone.
