The `+` in the regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._]+$/` is a **quantifier** that means **"one or more"** of the preceding characters.

### Explanation of the Regex:
1. **`^`**:
   - Matches the **start** of the string.

2. **`[a-zA-Z0-9._]`**:
   - Matches any single character that is:
     - A lowercase letter (`a-z`)
     - An uppercase letter (`A-Z`)
     - A digit (`0-9`)
     - A dot (`.`)
     - An underscore (`_`)

3. **`+`**:
   - Matches **one or more** of the preceding characters (from `[a-zA-Z0-9._]`).
   - This ensures that the username must contain at least one valid character.

4. **`$`**:
   - Matches the **end** of the string.

### Why Use `+`?
The `+` ensures that the username is not empty. Without it, the regex would match an empty string, which is not valid for a username.

---

### Example Matches:
- ✅ `john_doe`
- ✅ `john.doe123`
- ✅ `user_1`
- ✅ `a`

### Example Non-Matches:
- ❌ `""` (empty string)
- ❌ `john..doe` (consecutive dots, if additional validation is applied)
- ❌ `john@doe` (contains invalid character `@`)

---

If you want to enforce a **minimum or maximum length**, you can use `{min,max}` quantifiers instead of `+`. For example:
```regex
/^[a-zA-Z0-9._]{2,30}$/
```
This ensures the username is between 2 and 30 characters long.
