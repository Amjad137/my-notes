  .regex(
          /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/,
          'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character'
        ),
    The original regex uses "lookaheads" (`(?=...)`) to check all requirements in one expression, while the new approach validates each requirement separately.
