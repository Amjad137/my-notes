The error occurs because Windows has a default maximum path length of 260 characters (`MAX_PATH`). When cloning a Git repository, if the file path exceeds this limit, you’ll encounter this error.

Here’s how to resolve it:

---

### **Solutions**

#### **1. Enable Long Path Support in Windows**

Modern versions of Windows 10 and 11 support paths longer than 260 characters, but the feature is disabled by default.

1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to:
    
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
    ```
    
3. Find the entry `LongPathsEnabled`.
4. Double-click it and set the value to `1`.
5. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

---

#### **2. Use the `core.longpaths` Setting in Git**

Git has a `core.longpaths` option that allows it to handle long paths.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global core.longpaths true
    ```
    

This allows Git to handle long paths during operations like cloning.

#### **3. Clone the Repository in a Shorter Directory Path**

The length of the path includes the base directory where you clone the repository. Reducing the base path can help.

1. Navigate to a directory closer to the root of your drive (e.g., `C:\`).
2. Clone the repository there:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> C:\repo
    ```
    

---

#### **4. Use the `--depth` Option for a Shallow Clone**

A shallow clone reduces the number of commits and files fetched, potentially avoiding long path issues.

1. Use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 <repository-url>
    ```
    
2. If needed, fetch the full history later:
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --unshallow
    ```
    

---

#### **5. Shorten the File Names in the Repository (If You Can)**

If you manage the repository, consider renaming files or directories with excessively long names to make them shorter. Then push the changes to the repository.

### **Verify After Changes**

After applying one or more of the solutions, try cloning the repository again:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
