# Fixing the Git Revert Editor Issue

You're having an issue with Git trying to open Vim as an editor for your revert commit message. Here are a few ways to solve this:

## Option 1: Provide a commit message directly

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

This will use a default revert message without opening an editor.

Or with a custom message:

```bash
git revert HEAD -m "Reverting the previous commit"
```

## Option 2: Set a different editor for Git

```bash
# Set Notepad as your Git editor (Windows)
git config --global core.editor notepad

# Or for VS Code
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Then try again
git revert HEAD
```

## Option 3: Fix the vim configuration

If you want to use Vim but it's not configured properly:

```bash
# On Windows
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Vim/vim82/vim.exe' -f"

# Then try again
git revert HEAD
```

## Option 4: One-time editor override

```bash
EDITOR=notepad git revert HEAD
```

After successfully reverting the commit, don't forget to push your changes:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The easiest solution for now is probably the first option: `git revert HEAD --no-edit`
