If you want to **revert changes in Git**, you have several options depending on the scenario. Let me explain the common cases and how to handle them:

---

### 1. **Revert a Single Commit**
Use this if you want to undo a specific commit but keep the rest of the history intact.

#### Command:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

- This creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git revert 2a86d98
  ```

---

### 2. **Revert to a Previous State**
Use this if you want to reset your repository to a specific commit.

#### Commands:
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force
```

- **Hard reset** erases changes in the working directory and index, resetting to the given commit.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard daa25f9
  git push --force
  ```

⚠️ Be cautious when using `--force`. It rewrites history, and other collaborators may lose work if they're not in sync.

### 3. **Revert All Commits in One Go**
If you want to reset your branch to the initial state (wiping all commits), use this:

#### Command:
```bash
git reset --hard <initial-commit-hash>
git push --force
```

- Find the initial commit hash:
  ```bash
  git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
  ```
- Reset to it:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard <hash>
  git push --force
  ```

---

### 4. **Undo Local Changes Only**
If the changes are local and not yet committed, use:

#### Discard Changes in Working Directory:
```bash
git checkout -- .
```

#### Discard Changes in Staging Area:
```bash
git reset
```

#### Example:
To remove all untracked files and reset to the latest commit:
```bash
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
```

---

### 5. **Revert a Merge Commit**
If you want to undo a merge commit, use:

#### Command:
```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```

- `-m 1` specifies the parent branch you want to keep.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git revert -m 1 2eacbdc
  ```

---

### 6. **Revert Remote Changes**
If you've pushed changes to the remote and want to undo them, follow these steps:

#### Reset Locally:
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

#### Force Push to Remote:
```bash
git push --force
```

---

### Which Method to Choose?
- Use `git revert` if you want to preserve history while undoing changes.
- Use `git reset --hard` if you're okay with rewriting history (be cautious with shared branches).
