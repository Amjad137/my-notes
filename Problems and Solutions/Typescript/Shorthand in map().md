Great question! Let's break down both syntaxes and focus on how the second one works.

---

### 1. `data.contentIds.map(id => Number(id))`

This is the more **explicit** way of converting each item in `data.contentIds` to a number using an **arrow function**:

* `id => Number(id)` is a callback function that:

  * Takes an argument `id` (each element in `contentIds`)
  * Converts it to a number using `Number(id)`
* `.map(...)` applies that conversion to every item in the array.

---

### 2. `data.contentIds.map(Number)`

This is a **shorthand** version using `Number` **directly as the callback function**.

Here's why it works:

* `.map()` expects a function that takes an element and returns a transformed value.
* `Number` is itself a function that takes a single argument and returns its numeric form:

  ```js
  Number('5') // 5
  Number('42') // 42
  Number('abc') // NaN
  ```
* So `map(Number)` is like writing:

  ```js
  data.contentIds.map((item) => Number(item))
  ```

#### Why it works:

JavaScript functions are *first-class citizens*, which means you can pass them around just like variables. Since `Number` already takes one argument and returns a value, it's compatible with how `.map()` calls its callback.

### Summary

| Syntax                  | Description                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `map(id => Number(id))` | Explicit arrow function                |
| `map(Number)`           | Shorthand: passes `Number` as callback |

They behave the same in this case, and the second one is just shorter and cleaner.
