Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs unpack that TypeScript line step by step, because it‚Äôs using several concepts at once:

```ts
export type RequestStatus = (typeof REQUEST_STATUS)[keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS];
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `typeof REQUEST_STATUS`

* **What it means:**
  In TypeScript, `typeof` (in a *type position*) gets the **type** of a value/variable.
* Example:

  ```ts
  const user = { name: "Amjath", age: 25 };
  type UserType = typeof user;
  // UserType is { name: string; age: number }
  ```
* So, if `REQUEST_STATUS` is an object, `typeof REQUEST_STATUS` is the **object type**.

Example:

```ts
const REQUEST_STATUS = {
  PENDING: "pending",
  SUCCESS: "success",
  ERROR: "error",
};
type RequestStatusType = typeof REQUEST_STATUS;
// RequestStatusType is:
// { PENDING: string; SUCCESS: string; ERROR: string }
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS`

* `keyof` gets the **union of keys** from a type.
* Example:

  ```ts
  type Keys = keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS;
  // Keys is "PENDING" | "SUCCESS" | "ERROR"
  ```
* So now we have a type representing only the keys of the object.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `(typeof REQUEST_STATUS)[keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS]`

* This is **indexed access type** syntax ‚Äî think of it like ‚Äúlook up the type of a property by its key‚Äù.
* `(SomeType)[SomeKeyUnion]` means:
  ‚ÄúGet the types of all properties whose keys are in `SomeKeyUnion`‚Äù.

Example:

```ts
type Values = (typeof REQUEST_STATUS)[keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS];
// This becomes: RequestStatusType["PENDING" | "SUCCESS" | "ERROR"]
// Which is: "pending" | "success" | "error"
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ `export type RequestStatus = ...`

* Finally, we export that **union of values** as a type:

```ts
export type RequestStatus = "pending" | "success" | "error";
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
That one line:

```ts
export type RequestStatus = (typeof REQUEST_STATUS)[keyof typeof REQUEST_STATUS];
```

means:

> ‚ÄúTake the `REQUEST_STATUS` object, look at all of its values, and make a type that is a union of those values.‚Äù

---

üí° **Why use this?**
Because if you ever change `REQUEST_STATUS`:

```ts
const REQUEST_STATUS = {
  PENDING: "pending",
  SUCCESS: "success",
  ERROR: "error",
  CANCELLED: "cancelled"
} as const;
```

Then `RequestStatus` **automatically** becomes:

```ts
"pending" | "success" | "error" | "cancelled"
```

No need to manually update the type.

If you want, I can show you a **minimal working example** with `as const` so you don‚Äôt lose literal value types.
That‚Äôs actually the key trick that makes this super type-safe.
