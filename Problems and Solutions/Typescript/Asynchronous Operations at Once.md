If we wan to perform multiple asynchronous operations at once, we can use Promise

The code snippet you provided uses `Promise.all` to execute two asynchronous operations concurrently. Here's a detailed explanation of the syntax and its purpose:

### 1. **`await` Keyword**
- `await` pauses the execution of the code until the `Promise` it is waiting for is resolved or rejected.
- In this case, `await` is used before `Promise.all`, meaning the function will wait for both promises to complete before proceeding.

### 2. **`Promise.all([])`**
- `Promise.all` takes an array of promises and runs them concurrently (in parallel).
- It returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, or rejects if any of the promises reject.
- This is useful when you need multiple asynchronous tasks to be completed before moving forward, but you want them to run concurrently to save time.

### 3. **The Array of Promises**
Inside `Promise.all`, you have two asynchronous operations:

#### a) **`oneTimeCodeService.remove({...})`**
- This promise deletes a record from the `oneTimeCodeService`, possibly removing an OTP (one-time password) or code for a specific user.
- **`where: { id: code.id }`**: The `remove` method is removing a record where the `id` matches the `code.id`.

#### b) **`userService.update({...})`**
- This promise updates a user record in the `userService`.
- **`data: user`**: The user object is provided to update the user with new or modified data.
- **`where: { id: user.id }`**: It updates the user where the `id` matches `user.id`.

### 4. **The Purpose**
The purpose of this `Promise.all` block is to:
- Remove a one-time code from the `oneTimeCodeService`.
- Update the user's information in the `userService`.

Both of these operations happen concurrently, and `await Promise.all` ensures that the function will wait for both the deletion and update to be completed before proceeding.

### 5. **Why Use `Promise.all`?**
- **Performance**: Instead of waiting for one operation to complete and then starting the next one, both operations are started at the same time. This can significantly improve performance if the operations can be done independently.
- **Error Handling**: If either of the promises fails (rejects), `Promise.all` will reject with an error. This means you can handle all errors together (e.g., in a `try...catch` block).

### Example of Handling Errors:
To handle potential errors from `Promise.all`, you might wrap this in a `try...catch` block:

```ts
try {
  await Promise.all([
    oneTimeCodeService.remove({
      where: { id: code.id }
    }),
    userService.update({
      data: user,
      where: { id: user.id }
    })
  ]);
  // Continue with further processing after both promises resolve
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors if any promise is rejected
  console.error("Error processing tasks:", error);
}
```

In summary:
- The `await Promise.all([...])` block is running two asynchronous operations concurrently.
- It waits for both the code removal and user update to complete before moving to the next steps in your code.
