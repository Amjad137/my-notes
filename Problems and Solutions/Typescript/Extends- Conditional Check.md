In TypeScript, the `extends` keyword within a type definition works differently from how you might see it in a class inheritance context. When used in the context of a type definition, `extends` performs a **structural check** rather than a class inheritance check. It's a form of conditional type that checks whether a type `T` satisfies (extends or is assignable to) a specific structure.

Let's break down how this works.

### `extends` in Conditional Types:

When you write `T extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus }`, TypeScript is essentially asking the question:

**"Does the type `T` have all the properties and types required by the type `{ status: KycFieldReviewStatus }`?"**

If the answer is **yes** (i.e., `T` has a `status` property, and the type of `status` is `KycFieldReviewStatus`), the condition is considered true. If the answer is **no** (i.e., `T` does not have a `status` property, or `status` is of a different type), the condition is considered false.

This kind of check is called **assignability**. In TypeScript's type system, one type is assignable to another if it has at least the same properties with the same types (or more specific ones).

### Example:

Consider the following types:

```typescript
type A = { status: KycFieldReviewStatus; name: string };
type B = { status: string; name: string };
type C = { name: string };
```

Now, letâ€™s use `extends` in a conditional type:

```typescript
type ResultA = A extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus } ? true : false;
type ResultB = B extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus } ? true : false;
type ResultC = C extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus } ? true : false;
```

- `ResultA`: Since `A` has a `status` property, and its type is exactly `KycFieldReviewStatus`, the condition is true, so `ResultA` becomes `true`.
- `ResultB`: While `B` has a `status` property, its type is `string`, not `KycFieldReviewStatus`. Therefore, the condition is false, so `ResultB` becomes `false`.
- `ResultC`: Since `C` does not even have a `status` property, the condition is false, so `ResultC` becomes `false`.

### How This Becomes a Conditional Check:

In a regular JavaScript `if` statement, you might check conditions using comparative operators like `===`, `>`, etc. However, in TypeScript's type system, you are not comparing values but **types**. The `extends` keyword in a conditional type acts as the "comparison operator" by checking **type compatibility**:

- If `T` is compatible with `{ status: KycFieldReviewStatus }`, then `T extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus }` evaluates to true.
- If `T` is not compatible, it evaluates to false.

### Conditional Type Recap:

In a conditional type:

```typescript
T extends U ? X : Y
```

- `T extends U` acts like a condition:
  - If `T` is assignable to `U`, it returns `X`.
  - If `T` is not assignable to `U`, it returns `Y`.

In your case:

```typescript
type FieldWithStatus<T> = T extends { status: KycFieldReviewStatus } ? T : never;
```

- If `T` has a `status` property of type `KycFieldReviewStatus`, it returns `T`.
- If `T` does not meet this condition, it returns `never`.

This is how the `extends` keyword functions as a conditional check in TypeScript type definitions.
