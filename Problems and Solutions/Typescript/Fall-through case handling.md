Ahh got it â€” youâ€™re asking specifically about this syntax:

```ts
case USER_ROLE.ADMIN:
case USER_ROLE.COUNSELLOR:
  // do something
  break;
```

### ðŸ§  This is called **fall-through case handling** in a `switch` statement.

Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### ðŸ§© What it does:

This syntax groups **multiple `case` values** to share the **same logic block**.

So this:

```ts
case USER_ROLE.ADMIN:
case USER_ROLE.COUNSELLOR:
  // logic here
  break;
```

...is **exactly the same as** writing:

```ts
if (role === USER_ROLE.ADMIN || role === USER_ROLE.COUNSELLOR) {
  // logic here
}
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Why it's useful

Instead of duplicating code for similar cases:

```ts
case USER_ROLE.ADMIN:
  break;

case USER_ROLE.COUNSELLOR:
  break;
```

You just group them:

```ts
case USER_ROLE.ADMIN:
case USER_ROLE.COUNSELLOR:
  // shared logic for both
  break;
```

Which is **cleaner, more maintainable**, and expresses:  
> "Both of these roles are handled the same way."

---

### âœ… You can stack as many as you want:

```ts
case 'apple':
case 'banana':
case 'grape':
  console.log('This is a fruit!');
  break;
```

Let me know if you want a visual flow or mental model to remember how this fall-through works.
