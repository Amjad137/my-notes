### What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a programming practice that limits the rate at which a function can fire. It's particularly useful for search inputs to prevent too many API calls while the user is still typing.

### Code Breakdown

```typescript
const handleDebounceSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce((e) => setSearch(e.target.value), 1000),
  []
);
```

Here's what's happening:

1. [debounce](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/moham/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) (from lodash):
    
    - Takes a function as first argument
    - Takes a delay time in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second) as second argument
    - Returns a new function that will only execute after the specified delay
2. The debounced function:
    
    - `(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)`: Updates the search state with input value
    - Only triggers after the user stops typing for 1 second
3. [useMemo](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/moham/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html):
    
    - Memoizes the debounced function
    - Empty dependency array `[]` means it's created only once when component mounts
    - Prevents recreating the debounced function on every render

### Example Flow:

4. User types "he" → No API call yet
5. User types "hel" → No API call yet
6. User types "hello" → No API call yet
7. User stops typing for 1 second → API call with "hello"

### Benefits:

- Reduces number of API calls
- Improves performance
- Better user experience
- Prevents unnecessary server load
