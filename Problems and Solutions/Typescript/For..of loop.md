The syntax `for (const member of invitedMembers)` is a type of loop in JavaScript called a "for...of" loop. This loop is used to iterate over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It allows you to loop through the values of an iterable object.

### Breakdown of the Syntax:

- `const member`: This part declares a new variable `member` that will hold the value of each element in the `invitedMembers` array as the loop iterates through it. Using `const` means that the variable `member` cannot be reassigned within the loop, though its properties can be modified if it is an object. You could also use `let` if you prefer.
  
- `of`: This keyword specifies that you are iterating over the values of the iterable object (in this case, `invitedMembers`).

- `invitedMembers`: This is the iterable object you are looping over. In this context, it is assumed to be an array containing a list of members.

### Example:

```javascript
const invitedMembers = [
  { id: 1, firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
  { id: 2, firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Smith', email: 'jane.smith@example.com' },
];

for (const member of invitedMembers) {
  console.log(`Sending email to ${member.firstName} ${member.lastName} at ${member.email}`);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The loop initializes the `member` variable to the first element of the `invitedMembers` array.

2. **Condition**: 
   - The loop automatically continues to the next element of the `invitedMembers` array until it has iterated over all elements.

3. **Iteration**: 
   - In each iteration, the `member` variable is set to the current element of the `invitedMembers` array.

4. **Loop Body**: 
   - The code inside the loop body is executed for each element in the `invitedMembers` array. In this example, it logs a message to the console for each member.

### When to Use "for...of" Loop:

- **Arrays**: When you need to iterate over the values in an array.
- **Strings**: To iterate over each character in a string.
- **Maps and Sets**: To iterate over the entries or values.
- **Generators**: To iterate over values produced by a generator.

### Comparison with "for...in" Loop:

- `for...of`: Iterates over the values of an iterable.
- `for...in`: Iterates over the keys (property names) of an object.

### Example Comparison:

```javascript
const array = [10, 20, 30];

// for...of loop
for (const value of array) {
  console.log(value); // Logs 10, 20, 30
}

// for...in loop
for (const key in array) {
  console.log(key); // Logs 0, 1, 2
}
```

In summary, `for (const member of invitedMembers)` is a convenient way to iterate over each element in an array (`invitedMembers`) and perform actions on each element (`member`).
