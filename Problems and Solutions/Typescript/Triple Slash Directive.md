when we are in need of telling typescript a set of foreign type sets which are coming from certain API, we can use this.

`/// <reference types="stripe-event-types" />`

This is a special syntax used to include reference comments in TypeScript files. These comments provide instructions to the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and other tools about how to handle the file during compilation and code analysis.
1. `///`: The triple-slash syntax begins with three forward slashes (`///`). This marks the comment as a directive rather than a regular comment.
2. `<reference ... />`: This part of the directive specifies the type of reference being made. In the case of `/// <reference ... />`, it's indicating that the comment is a reference directive.
3. `types="..."`: Within the reference directive, `types` is an attribute used to specify the type of reference being included. In this case, `"stripe-event-types"` indicates that the reference is for type definitions related to the Stripe API event types.
4. `stripe-event-types`: The value within the `types` attribute specifies the name of the package or module whose type definitions should be included. In this example, it's referring to the `stripe-event-types` package.

The purpose of this triple-slash directive is to ensure that the TypeScript compiler includes the type definitions provided by the `stripe-event-types` package when compiling the TypeScript code in the current file. This allows the TypeScript compiler to perform type checking and provide type inference for variables, functions, and other constructs in the codebase related to Stripe event handling.
