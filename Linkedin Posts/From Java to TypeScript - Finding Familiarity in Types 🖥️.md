Starting my programming journey with Java gave me a strong foundation in understanding types, interfaces, and object-oriented principles. So, when I dove into TypeScript, I immediately noticed some familiar concepts. Both languages emphasize type safety, making it easier to catch errors early and build more reliable code.

One small example: Java and TypeScript share a common approach to defining return types in functions.

```java

public double calculateArea(double width, double height) {
    return width * height;
}
```

```typescript

function calculateArea(width: number, height: number): number {
    return width * height;
}
```

That Java background helped me pick up TypeScript faster and appreciate the structure it brings to JavaScript projects. For anyone looking to transition to TypeScript, especially if you have experience with Java, youâ€™ll find a lot to build on. Embrace the similarities, and enjoy exploring the new features!
